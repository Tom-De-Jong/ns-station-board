# NS Station board

This is a project which uses the NS api (nederlandse spoorwegen) which is the api of the dutch railways to get information about the next train that will enter the station. Its based on the boards on the station which show the information and the ui is a clone but im writing every piece of code myself!

when you open the page you see an input with the choice to change the station that this board is located at (UIC CODE) theres a default one if you don't care and once you press on the "Doorgaan!" button the board opens up with realtime updates!

## If you don't speak dutch theres an english option!

 i’ve only used ai to help me with javascript api fetching (i really hate that part and should maybe learn how javascript fetching works.) NOTE: json api data handling was done myself
